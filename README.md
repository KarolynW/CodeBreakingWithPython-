## What is Python?

Python was first developed in the 1980s by Guido van Rossum. It is a popular general-purpose programming language used for a wide variety of applications. Python includes high-level data structures, dynamic typing, dynamic binding, and many other features that make it useful for both complex application development and scripting or "glue code" that connects components together. Additionally, Python can be extended to make system calls to almost all operating systems and to run code written in C or C++.

Due to its ubiquity and ability to run on nearly every system architecture, Python is a universal language found in a variety of different applications. It is one of the simplest yet most powerful programming languages in the world. Today, we will take your first steps in creating your first programs!

## What is Google Colaboratory?

**Google Colaboratory (Colab)** allows you to write and execute Python in your browser, with:

- Zero configuration required
- Free access to GPUs
- Easy sharing

## What is Cryptography?

Cryptography is the study of secure communications techniques that allow only the sender and intended recipient of a message to view its contents. The term is derived from the Greek word *kryptos*, meaning hidden. Cryptography is closely associated with encryption, which involves scrambling ordinary text into ciphertext and then converting it back upon receipt.

In addition to encryption, cryptography also covers the obfuscation of information in images using techniques such as microdots or merging. Ancient Egyptians used these methods in complex hieroglyphics, and Roman Emperor Julius Caesar is credited with using one of the first modern ciphers.

Cryptography has gained increased interest due to the rise of cryptocurrencies and is a field of great significance today.
